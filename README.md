# Final_Project
 
In my research, I came across a sensor that has piqued my interest - the APDS-9960 Gesture sensor. This sensor is capable of recognizing gestures as well as colors, which I find fascinating. As a result, I am eager to incorporate this sensor into my final project and conduct some interesting experiments with it.

Gravity Game
In the past few weeks of my course, I created a platform-jumping game using p5.play, where the direction of gravity changes over time. I'd like to take this concept a step further and replace the way gravity changes with gesture control. This would allow players to freely alter the direction of gravity through the sensor, thereby increasing the ball's survival time or scoring more points. However, I haven't yet decided on how the ball should move when it's not under the player's control.

Fireworks Show
With the growing awareness of environmental conservation, is there a better way to replicate the effects of traditional fireworks? I'm considering using Arduino and p5.js to create a fireworks display with particle effects. Players would be able to control the direction and trajectory of the fireworks' ascent through gestures. Additionally, they could change the color of the fireworks by sensing different RGB-colored cards, creating a visually stunning spectacle.

Text Capture
I'd like to create an artistic effect to represent a state of mind during our learning process. The idea is to encircle various stationery items in a rotating circle, with two main circles inside it. As the outer circle rotates, different texts continuously emanate from the center of the screen towards the periphery. Players can use gestures to rotate the large circle left and right, allowing the smaller circle to capture the text and score points.

Water Flow
In the center of the screen, there is a visual effect resembling flowing water. Players can change the direction of the water flow patterns by swiping their hands left or right and adjust the density of the water patterns by swiping their hands up or down. The color of the water flow can be altered using color cards.

Rotating Pets
The main composition of the screen consists of several cats/dogs that are similar but have different colors. They are arranged in a circular pattern and rotate towards the center. Players can control the direction of the rotation of all the pet heads/tails through gestures, as if they were petting them.
